vars:
    first text
    second text
    operation



if (/[\*\-\/\+]/.test(val)) {


javascript check if variable exists 
if (typeof myVar !== 'undefined') {
    // myVar is defined
}

We cannot undeclare a variable. However, we can set its value to undefined for the purpose
nxt = undefined; 



if
    number
        add to text
        which one?
        if operation already set : add to second
        else add to first


else
    operation
        if operation already set : 
            run operation, reset all and dump result in first
        else : 
            simply set operation
